**This provides the completed projects for:**
- portfolio
- music-master
- react-app-template
- evens-or-odds
- starter
- react-hooks

**In this course, you will:**

**Dive into React code right away**. You will gain relevant experience as soon as the first section. Time is precious. And I want to make sure that you’ll never feel like you’re wasting it in this course. So in a matter of minutes, you will be writing React code in the first section, with a fully completed app by the end of it.

**Understand how React fits in the big picture of web development**. In the second section, you will take an important step back and examine how React fits in the big picture of web development. You’ll build a React project from scratch - discovering all the layers that are in between the supplies that supports the React app, and the browser which displays the React app.

**Create relevant and compelling React apps**. I’m betting you’ll find the apps both useful and interesting. Useful ones like the portfolio app will help you both learn React, and be valuable as a completed project for your software engineering and web developer profile. Fun ones like “Music Master”, will make coding lively, giving you apps you want to show off to your friends and family.
